# PiPifier
PiPifier is a native macOS 10.12 Safari extension that lets you use every HTML5 video in Picture in Picture mode

#Download
It's free on the Mac AppStore. Get it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/pipifier-pip-for-nearly-every/id1160374471?mt=12)

# How to use?
If you have an HTML5 video playing on any website like Youtube just press the PiPifier icon in Safari's toolbar to enable Picture-In-Picture for this video. Make sure you did interact with the video player once before pressing (like play/pause).

#How can I help?
If you are a developer feel free to make any addition to improve PiPifier.

If you are user and want a native PiP button in any video player please make a request in the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/arnoappenzeller/PiPifier/issues/12)

#Note for developers
The code is a bit dirty and there are some unused parts in it (Tried to add more features before I needed to focus on other things). If you want to help me clean it up feel free to do so :)
